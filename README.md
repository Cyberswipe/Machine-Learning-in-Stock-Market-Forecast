Analysis of statistical and predictive algorithms on real time stock market data (Time-series modeling)

# Abstract

Predicting stock market closing prices is a challenging yet critical task for investors, financial analysts, and traders aiming to make informed decisions. This project endeavors to forecast stock market closing prices for a custom time frame using data obtained from the Yahoo Finance API. To achieve this, four distinct machine learning forecasting models are deployed, namely ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Stock market data is known for its volatility, affected by various economic, political, and social factors. To navigate this dynamic landscape, the project applies machine learning models to harness patterns and trends within historical stock price data. For instance, considering a time frame spanning weeks or months, the stock price prediction becomes a valuable tool for investors to make timely buy or sell decisions. These machine learning models provide the means to process and analyze historical stock market data efficiently. They extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends, enabling the generation of closing price forecasts for a custom time frame. By leveraging these models, investors and financial analysts can make data-driven predictions, better understand market behavior, and optimize their investment strategies. The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in empowering market participants with tools for data-driven decision-making, fostering improved financial outcomes within a custom time frame
